## ‚úÖ Pre-flight Checklist

- [ ] Auth0 account access
- [ ] Streamlit Cloud deployment ready
- [ ] Google Sheets with mentor data
- [ ] Email service for verification codes

## üîß Step 1: Auth0 Setup (Already Done!) ‚úÖ

**Good news!** Your Auth0 is already configured and working with domain `dev-l6j5dixd3desex41.us.auth0.com`.

### Verify Current Configuration
1. Login to [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/)
2. Check your existing application settings
3. Ensure these are configured:

```
Application Type: Single Page Application
Token Endpoint Authentication Method: POST
Allowed Callback URLs: http://localhost:8501
Allowed Web Origins: http://localhost:8501
```

### ‚ö° Quick Check: Enable Passwordless Email
1. Go to Authentication ‚Üí Passwordless in Auth0 dashboard
2. If not already enabled, toggle ON "Email"
3. Configure email template:
   - Subject: `Your Project TYRA Login Code`
   - Body: `Your verification code is: {{ code }}`

### üåê For Production Deployment
When you deploy to Streamlit Cloud, you'll need to update:
1. **Auth0 Settings**: Add your production URL to Allowed Callback URLs
2. **Secrets**: Update `auth0_redirect_uri` to your production URL

**If passwordless email is already enabled, you're all set! Skip to Step 2.**

### Copy Credentials
```
Domain: dev-l6j5dixd3desex41.us.auth0.com
Client ID: P5EMWnVXS1mKga0uGb4OthQG2A1kmKOA
Client Secret: VtmmR_DM0cJ2oyRYXas_xff3FDaaGOA-c2KBHQyJIY2FL8lhZiN-QCrsIGfUUy6h
```

---

## üîë Step 2: Streamlit Secrets (Already Done!) ‚úÖ

Your `.streamlit/secrets.toml` already contains the working Auth0 configuration:

```toml
# Auth0 (Already configured and working!)
auth0_domain = "dev-l6j5dixd3desex41.us.auth0.com"
auth0_client_id = "P5EMWnVXS1mKga0uGb4OthQG2A1kmKOA"
auth0_client_secret = "VtmmR_DM0cJ2oyRYXas_xff3FDaaGOA-c2KBHQyJIY2FL8lhZiN-QCrsIGfUUy6h"
auth0_redirect_uri = "http://localhost:8501"

# Your existing Google Sheets URLs (already working)
mentee_response_sheet_url = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kcukr9kPwohcdYNY4Tf9LIk2ftgOJsY0sMdzFNghzF0/edit?gid=1463194027#gid=1463194027"
mentor_sheet_url = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kDgAl5ermaQtDNPYJJavsVt9lhG9ENmsxjRmT_tmmNQ/edit?gid=496135894#gid=496135894"
mentor_matched_url = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10uWmgQWPywMLFpk8Y0X60cRNLtlnYjERz7Zrhyajltg/edit?gid=1667277099#gid=1667277099"
mentee_matched_url = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P7LeoiBmSJmgLOffZRIwER-PZ7--dN6YbRxyTqKBqEQ/edit?gid=1289745482#gid=1289745482"
```

**‚ú® Since your Auth0 is already configured, you can skip directly to Step 3!**

---

## üìä Step 3: Verify Data Format (Already Done!) ‚úÖ

Your mentor sheet at:
`https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kDgAl5ermaQtDNPYJJavsVt9lhG9ENmsxjRmT_tmmNQ/edit?gid=496135894`

Should have these columns (which you likely already have):
```
verification_code | name | email | combined_mentor_id
ABC123           | John | john@example.com | john_smith_2025
```

**‚ú® Since your verification code system already works, your data format is correct!**

---

## üöÄ Step 4: Deploy Enhanced App (Ready to Go!) 

**Since your Auth0 and data are already configured, you can deploy immediately:**

### Option A: Replace Existing App
```bash
# Backup current app
cp app_matching_confirmation_round_1.py app_backup.py

# Deploy enhanced version
cp app_screening_enhanced.py app_matching_confirmation_round_1.py
```

### Option B: Deploy as New App (Recommended for Testing)
```bash
# Keep both versions running
# Enhanced app is ready as app_screening_enhanced.py
streamlit run app_screening_enhanced.py
```

**üéØ Recommended**: Start with Option B to test, then switch to Option A when satisfied.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 5: Test Both Methods (2 minutes)

### Test Verification Code (Should Work Immediately)
1. Open enhanced app ‚Üí Verification Code tab
2. Enter any existing verification code from your mentor sheet
3. Verify mentor dashboard loads with existing functionality

### Test Email OTP (New Feature)
1. Open enhanced app ‚Üí Email OTP tab
2. Enter a mentor email address from your mentor sheet
3. Check inbox for 6-digit code from Auth0
4. Enter code and verify access

**üîç Troubleshooting**: If email OTP doesn't work immediately, check that passwordless email is enabled in your Auth0 dashboard at `dev-l6j5dixd3desex41.us.auth0.com`.

---

## üîí Security Verification

After deployment, verify these security features work:

- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Try 6 wrong codes ‚Üí should block
- [ ] **Input Validation**: Try `<script>` in code field ‚Üí should reject
- [ ] **Session Timeout**: Leave idle 1+ hours ‚Üí should auto-logout
- [ ] **Audit Logging**: Check logs for authentication events

---

## üÜò Immediate Troubleshooting

### "Auth0 not configured" warning
**Fix**: Double-check `auth0_domain` in secrets.toml

### "Email not found" error
**Fix**: Verify email exists in mentor sheet `email` column

### Rate limiting too aggressive
**Fix**: Adjust time window in `check_rate_limit()` function

### OTP emails not sending
**Fix**: Check Auth0 passwordless email configuration

---

## üìã Production Deployment Checklist

### Before Going Live
- [ ] Test both authentication methods
- [ ] Verify all mentor emails are in database
- [ ] Configure proper error monitoring
- [ ] Set up backup authentication method
- [ ] Document emergency access procedures

### Communication to Mentors
```
Subject: New Login Options Available - Project TYRA

Dear Mentors,

We've enhanced the security of our mentor dashboard with two login options:

1. **Verification Code** (same as before)
   - Use your existing verification code

2. **Email Login** (new option)
   - Enter your registered email
   - Receive a 6-digit code instantly
   - More convenient for future access

Both methods provide the same secure access to your dashboard.

Best regards,
Project TYRA Team
```

- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback score >4.5/5

---

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

1. **Immediate**: Switch back to original app
   ```bash
   cp app_backup.py app_matching_confirmation_round_1.py
   ```

2. **Investigate**: Check logs and error reports

3. **Fix**: Address issues in enhanced version

4. **Redeploy**: When ready, switch back to enhanced version
